# ALS016

This industry best practice rule performs geometric calculations to assess geometric continuity between
successive `IfcCurveSegment` entities that make up an alignment representation.

This rule checks the shape representation (geometry) only and does not
utilize any information in the semantic (business logic) definition of the alignment.

The `Transition` attribute on 
[`IfcCurveSegment`](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4_3/HTML/lexical/IfcCurveSegment.htm)
is utilized to determine the model author's intended
continuity between segments.

A value of `.CONTINUOUS.` would mean that a warning for ALS016 could be raised positional discontinuity only
(not tangency).
Similarly, a value of `.DISCONTINUOUS.` would mean that a warning for ALS016 could not be raised,
full stop.
